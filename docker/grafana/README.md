# Grafana

[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is an open source tool for analytics. I use it to power a variety of dashboards of the homelab.

By itself, it doesn't include any sort of datastore. I use [Prometheus](../prometheus/) for that.

I've blogged about the configuration of Grafana over [here](https://brooks.sh/2018/06/03/monitoring-your-home-lab-with-grafana-in-docker/).
