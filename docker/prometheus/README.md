# Prometheus

Prometheus is a time series database that is the underlying datastore for [Grafana](../grafana). It operates on a "[pull model](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/faq/#why-do-you-pull-rather-than-push?)" in fetch metrics.

There are a few exporters in which I've configured Prometheus to pull from, they're defined below. My general rule of thumb of what services to put in Prometheus' `docker-compose.yml` is asking the question "Does this container make sense to run without Prometheus?". If the answer is yes, it belongs in its own `docker-compose.yml`.

## cAdvisor

[cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor) is a tool that analyzes resource usage and performance characteristics of running containers.

It ultimately powers a Grafana [dashboard](https://grafana.com/dashboards/193) that can tell me the impact each container is having on my NUC.

## SNMP Exporter

The snmp\_exporter is a tool that extracts data from SNMP and offers it to Prometheus to monitor my EdgeRouter X and LiteBeam.

There is a configuration file that was created from [this generator](https://github.com/prometheus/snmp_exporter/blob/26b3c855fb72b64527881a5acb8597ef49b00f9f/generator/README.md), and boy was it a doozy. It required finding a variety of MIBs for the Ubiquiti devices (pro tip: the EdgeRouter's MIBs are available in `/usr/share/snmp/mibs/`). And then `snmpwalk`'ing the various devices to find OIDs that I found interesting. Once those OIDs were in hand, I could use them as starting points for the generator config.

## Unifi

[Unifi](../unifi/) monitors my Unifi AP AC Pro.
