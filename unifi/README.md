# Unifi

Unifi is the tool that I use to configure my [UAP-AC-Pro](https://www.ubnt.com/unifi/unifi-ap-ac-pro/) wireless access point.

The [`docker-compose.yml`](./docker-compose.yml) file includes unifi\_exporter, a tool that extracts data from Unifi devices and offers it to [Prometheus](../prometheus/).
